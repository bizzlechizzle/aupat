- status
	- REMOVED FROM PROJECT
- reason
	- Domain normalization could destroy important URL information
	- Risk of data loss when extracting subdomains from full URLs
	- Multiple URLs from same user would collapse to same identifier
	- Conflicts with data integrity principles (BPA, BPL)
- alternative approach
	- Store full URL in database without normalization
	- Extract and store complete domain (e.g., username.smugmug.com)
	- Use full domain in file/folder names to keep them human-readable
	- Organize by url_uuid8 for unique identification
	- No destructive normalization or information loss
- previous concept
	- Originally planned to normalize complex hosting platforms
	- Extract canonical domains (username.smugmug.com → username)
	- Create clean folder organization by provider
	- DECISION: Rejected in favor of data integrity
- date removed
